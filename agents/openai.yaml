  default_prompt: "Use $novel-to-short-video to extract the single most compelling segment from my novel, ensure it forms a self-contained mini-story while ending with lingering curiosity, create a plan markdown from references/plan-template.md under docs/plans with date+chapter naming, wait for my approval, then ensure pictures/<content_name>/roles.json exists first (create it if missing using references/roles-json.md), reuse existing role prompts, and only append missing roles before generating prompts/images, then generate storyboard images and voiceover, and render a 50-60 second looping short video while keeping the Remotion project editable."
